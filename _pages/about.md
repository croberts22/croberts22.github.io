# üëã Hi! I'm Corey.

I'm a software engineer who loves writing in the Apple ecosystem and aspires to better peoples' lives with simple, intuitive software. I've been writing apps for iOS since 2012, and I've been enjoying every step of the journey to making delightful mobile experiences for everyone.

I've had the wonderful opportunity to work on some incredible apps in my professional career, including [MapMyRun](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/map-my-run-by-under-armour/id291890420), [MyFitnessPal](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/myfitnesspal/id341232718), and [My H-E-B](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/my-h-e-b/id1477891300). I'm currently working at [**H-E-B**](https://digital.heb.com/) as an iOS engineer.

In my personal time, I love to play videogames and work on maintaining my media server. I am also an avid fan of drinking coffee, crafting a nice old fashioned, and eating ramen.

### [#10758779 Activity tracking system with multiple monitoring devices](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=10758779.PN.&OS=PN/10758779&RS=PN/10758779)

A method for providing activity data to a user for a workout session includes receipt of first activity data from a first activity sensor and receipt of second activity data from a second activity sensor during the workout session. A first parameter is generated for a workout attribute based on the first activity data received during a first time interval of the workout session, and a second parameter is generated for the workout attribute based on the second activity data received during a second time interval of the workout session. An aggregate parameter for the workout attribute is generated based on both the first parameter and the second parameter. The first activity data and the second activity data generated during the workout session are transmitted to a remote server where a third parameter for the workout attribute is generated.
