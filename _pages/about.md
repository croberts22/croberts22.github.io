# üëã Hi! I'm Corey.

I'm a software engineer who loves writing in the Apple ecosystem and aspires to better peoples' lives with simple, intuitive software. I've been writing apps for iOS and iPadOS since 2012, and I've been enjoying every step of the journey to making delightful mobile experiences for everyone.

I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 2012 with a BS in Computer Science, and I decided to go back to get a Masters in Software Engineering in 2021.

I've had the wonderful opportunity to work on some incredible iOS apps in my professional career, including [MapMyRun](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/map-my-run-by-under-armour/id291890420), [MyFitnessPal](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/myfitnesspal/id341232718), [My H-E-B](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/my-h-e-b/id1477891300), and [Reddit](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reddit/id1064216828). I'm currently building out an extensive design system for iOS at [**Reddit**](https://www.reddit.com/).

In my personal time, I love to play videogames and work on maintaining my media server. I am also an avid fan of spending time with my amazing family, drinking coffee, and crafting a nice old fashioned.  

## My Projects

[MyAniList](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/myanilist/id741257899) is the premiere anime and manga tracking app designed for iOS. Utilizing the latest in iOS technologies, it is the best way to organize and update your lists, as well as discover new series to watch and read. Compare your lists and scores with friends on AniList.co to see where you stand.

### [Blog Post: Building Reddit's Design System on iOS](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/16rxnx4/building_reddits_design_system_on_ios/)

This blog post describes how the team at Reddit attempts to solve building a comprehensive, cohesive, and mature design system on iOS. I go to discuss the motivation behind building a design system, the architecture that drives Reddit's component library, and some of the future challenges we've yet to solve.

### [Patent #10758779: Activity tracking system with multiple monitoring devices](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=10758779.PN.&OS=PN/10758779&RS=PN/10758779)

A method for providing activity data to a user for a workout session includes receipt of first activity data from a first activity sensor and receipt of second activity data from a second activity sensor during the workout session. A first parameter is generated for a workout attribute based on the first activity data received during a first time interval of the workout session, and a second parameter is generated for the workout attribute based on the second activity data received during a second time interval of the workout session. An aggregate parameter for the workout attribute is generated based on both the first parameter and the second parameter. The first activity data and the second activity data generated during the workout session are transmitted to a remote server where a third parameter for the workout attribute is generated.

### [Forbes Reference for MyAniList](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurenorsini/2018/05/30/myanimelist-passes-third-day-of-unexpected-downtime/)

When MyAnimeList went down, a tweet of mine was referenced regarding the impact and what would eventually be the eventual migration of webservices from MyAnimeList to AniList.

While at UACF / MapMyRun, I worked alongside Apple to help prototype the workout intents integration of SiriKit. Much of the feedback I gave while working with the team in Cupertino allowed for developers to build out robust experiences with workout tracking through Siri. A screenshot of this integration was displayed and remarked by Craig Federighi during a tour of intents made available in iOS 10.
