# ðŸ‘‹ Hi. I'm Corey.

I'm a software engineer who loves writing in the Apple ecosystem and aspires to better peoples' lives with simple, intuitive software. I've been writing apps for iOS since 2012, and I've been enjoying every step of the journey to making delightful mobile experiences for everyone.

I've had the wonderful opportunity to work on some incredible apps in my professional career, including [MapMyRun](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/map-my-run-by-under-armour/id291890420), [MyFitnessPal](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/myfitnesspal/id341232718), and [My H-E-B](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/my-h-e-b/id1477891300). I'm currently working at H-E-B as an iOS engineer.
